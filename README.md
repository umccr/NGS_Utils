## NGS Utils

[![Conda version](https://anaconda.org/umccr/ngs_utils/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/umccr/ngs_utils)
[![Conda released](https://anaconda.org/umccr/ngs_utils/badges/latest_release_date.svg)](https://anaconda.org/umccr/ngs_utils)


Helper code for UMCCR projects (e.g. [umccrise](https://github.com/umccr/umccrise) and [Oviraptor](https://github.com/umccr/oviraptor).

Contains only python code without any heavy reference or test data, so supposed to be small and can be used as a lightweight dependency in other projects.
